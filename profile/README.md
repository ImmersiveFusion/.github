## Hi there 👋

[Immersive Fusion](immersivefusion.com) is an innovator in Application Performance Monitoring and Management (APM). As a growing and agile start-up, we are creating solutions to redefine the APM space with a focus on 3D and Virtual Reality as the presentation medium. Some of our solutions also address, conventional browser-based scenarios that are commonplace today. The Immersive Fusion flagship product, Immersive APM, serves other engineers, architects, operations and quality assurance personnel to troubleshoot, diagnose and improve their own, in-house, software applications.
